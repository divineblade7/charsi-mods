# Charsi

![Charis](./docs/images/charsi-x16.png) **Charsi** is a command-line tool to
help game modders build string resources for [Diablo II: Resurrected][1].

## Introduction

In the classic version of Diablo II, there was a very famous hacking tool called
d2maphack, which was powerful and could easily configure the text displayed in
the game.

Now in Diablo II: Resurrected, you can directly modify the JSON file to
implement it, but the workload is high, and it's easy to make mistakes.

So there is this tool that can help you quickly modify the JSON files of Diablo
II: Resurrected in a format similar to d2maphack configurations.
